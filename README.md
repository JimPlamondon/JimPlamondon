In my "retirement," I am dusting off my 1987 Computer Science degree -- unused for 25+ years -- to develop gamified online courseware.

Over the decade from 1022 to 1032 A.D., Guido d'Arezzo implemented a suite of new technologies that increased the efficiency of music education by 10x. Now, exactly a thousand years later, I hope to do likewise. However, I can't do it alone. If the prospect of accelerating music education by 10x intriques you, join me in designing and implementing JIMS Isomprphic Music System (JIMS).

Come change the world with me!
